# Common Terms

**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: is a secured communications channel over shared public networks to connect to a private network and access hosts and resources as if we were directly connected to the target private network. When connected to a VPN, data originates from the VPN server rather than our computer and will appear to originate from a public IP address other than our own.

**SSL VPN**: uses the web browser as the VPN client. The connection is established between the browser and an SSL VPN gateway can be configured to only allow access to web-based applications such as email and intranet sites, or even the internal network but without the need for the end user to install or use any specialized software.

**Client-based VPN**: requires the use of client software to establish the VPN connection. Once connected, the user's host will work mostly as if it were connected directly to the company network and will be able to access any resources (applications, hosts, subnets, etc.) allowed by the server configuration.

Connecting using a VPN:

    $ sudo openvpn user.ovpn

If we type **ifconfig** in another terminal window, we will see a **tun** adapter if we successfully connected to the VPN:

    $ ifconfig

    <SNIP>

    tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
            inet 10.10.x.2  netmask 255.255.254.0  destination 10.10.x.2

**netstat -rn** will show us the networks accessible via the VPN:

    $ netstat -rn

**Shell**: a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function.

| Shell Type    | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Reverse shell | Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box. |
| Bind shell    | "Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box. |
| Web shell     | Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a PHP script to run a single command. |

**Ports**: virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).

**TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol. Connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.

**UDP**: User Datagram Protocol. Utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. UDP is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself.

| Port(s)       | Protocol        |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 20/21 (TCP)   | FTP             |
| 22 (TCP)      | SSH             |
| 23 (TCP)      | Telnet          |
| 25 (TCP)      | SMTP            |
| 80 (TCP)      | HTTP            |
| 161 (TCP/UDP) | SNMP            |
| 389 (TCP/UDP) | LDAP            |
| 443 (TCP)     | SSL/TLS (HTTPS) |
| 445 (TCP)     | SMB             |
| 3389 (TCP)    | RDP             |

**Web server**: an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the HTTP traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser.

| Number | Category | Description |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Broken Access Control | Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc. |
| 2 | Cryptographic Failures | Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.|
| 3 | Injection | User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc. |
| 4 | Insecure Design | These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind. |
| 5 | Security Misconfiguration | Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information. |
| 6 | Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. |
| 7 | Identification and Authentication Failures | Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management. |
| 8 | Software and Data Integrity Failures | Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). |
| 9 | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. |
| 10 | Server-Side Request Forgery | SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL). |
